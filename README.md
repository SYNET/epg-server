SYNET EPG Server
================

This is a fast server to render electronic program guide (EPG) to embedded devices, 
such as set top boxes and mobile handsets. It loads initial data from XMLTV format plus
category association dictionary, stores in database (MySQL) and serves request using compact
binary protocol, eliminating the need for excess parsing on terminal's side.

This is not a standalone tool, as it requires SYNET interactive middleware to run on set top box.

Please follow [Configuration instructions](http://synet.synesis.ru/entries/438661-epg) or contact us via email [synet@synesis.ru](mailto:synet@synesis.ru)
